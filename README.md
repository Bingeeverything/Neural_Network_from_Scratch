# Neural_Network_from_Scratch
Tried learning, GDS and loss in the working of ai, learning


Learning neural networks by building from scratch in Python using NumPy. This project implements a basic feedforward neural network with backpropagation and gradient descent. Originally based on a tutorial   """https://github.com/vzhou842/neural-network-from-scratch""". Not complete yet, tracking learning progress

There are handwritten notes in the notes folder, from when i was learning and writing it down acc to my understanding
